# FAIR Working Groups

The FAIR Technical Steering Committee (TSC) organizes much of its efforts into Working Groups, often abbreviated WG in general communication. Each group has a specific mandate for its area of responsibility, and may hold separate meetings to plan and coordinate work. Some WGs are temporary, while others are permanent to address an ongoing need.

## **Active Working Groups**

### **AspireCloud Working Group**

**Special Note:** This working group was formed in collaboration with [AspirePress](https://aspirepress.org), who began work in October 2024 before the formation of FAIR. Future development of certain AspirePress projects will continue under the FAIR project, with names retained in recognition of the early work of the AspirePress team, most of whom continue to work on these projects under FAIR.

* **Type:** Permanent  
* **Began:** July 2025 (October 2024\)  
* **Chat:** \#wg-aspirecloud  
* **Mandate**:  
  * (1) Develop server-side software to index packages and respond to API calls in the [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org) format to serve download urls from a mirror of the [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org) software repository.  
  * (2) Support queries using the FAIR Protocol to provide DID-based package management and to present a unified set of search results for packages from the [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org) mirror and any other FAIR Repository it indexes. (e.g., using the Mini-FAIR Repo Plugin)  
  * (3) Coordinate with other FAIR software projects to support requirements as needed between projects.

## **Archived Working Groups**

### **Technical Independence**

* **Type:** Temporary  
* **Term:** Spring 2025 to June 5, 2025  
* **Mandate:** Create a WordPress plugin capable of replacing services supplied by [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org), or redirect to alternate sources via API or RSS as appropriate.  
* **Status:** Closed, Successful.

**Result:** A proof-of-concept plugin was developed to redirect software installations to AspireCloud, replacing other functions which relied on [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org)â€™s API with ones run locally within the plugin or from independent third-party sources. The FAIR Plugin was shipped and [announced publicly at the Alt-Ctrl event in Basel, Switzerland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owH0xMGsuCw) with the announcement of the formation of FAIR and collaboration with AspirePress.

To support the news feed in the WordPress Admin dashboard, a Planet instance was also created. The FAIR Plugin and Planet instance were handed to other Working Groups to maintain once the goals of the Technical Independence WG were achieved.
