# Get Involved

Do you want to help out the project? We're eager to welcome more contributors, and there are many ways you can help us out, ranging from testing, translating, development, or providing community feedback\!

## **GitHub**

The FAIR Package Manager primarily [works on GitHub](https://github.com/fairpm) \- it's the home for all of our initiatives, and where we do most of our work. If you want to contribute to FAIR, this is where you'll find all of our projects. Whether you want to help [refine the website](https://github.com/fairpm/fair-parent-theme), build out the [specifications for the package manager](https://github.com/fairpm/fair-protocol), or [contribute to our plugin](https://github.com/fairpm/fair-plugin), GitHub is the place to go\!

[Check out our Getting Started guide](https://github.com/fairpm/tsc/blob/main/getting-started.md) for essential information.

Anybody with a GitHub account can contribute to our repositories and be recognized as a contributor to the project. If you donâ€™t have an account yet, you can [create a GitHub account for free](https://github.com/signup). Be aware that all commits to [FAIR projects must be signed off](https://github.com/fairpm/tsc?tab=contributing-ov-file) in order to be merged.

## **Chat**

[Join our Slack instance](https://chat.fair.pm) to discuss the project outside of GitHub. While we try to keep decision making inside our GitHub issues and pull requests, a lot of discussion happens in Slack. 

## **OpenProfile/LFX**

FAIR's governance operates through the Linux Foundation. As such, if you want to attend project meetings, you'll need to [create a free profile on the Linux Foundation's Open Profile platform](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/). This platform also gives you [access to calendars](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meetings/fair-package-manager?view=month), meeting invites and recordings of past working group meetings.

## **Testing FAIR**

You can use FAIR on your own website today. Take a test drive and report any issues you see.

### **Connect your site to FAIR with the FAIR plugin**

The FAIR plugin is no different from any other plugin, and there's no configuration required. Download the latest version from the [FAIR Plugin releases page](https://github.com/fairpm/fair-plugin/releases).  You can discuss or report any issues in the [FAIR plugin's GitHub repository](https://github.com/fairpm/fair-plugin/issues).

### **Set up your own Mini-FAIR Repo**

The Mini-FAIR Repo plugin is used to create a repository of plugins on your own site. See [Installation for End Users (GitHub](https://github.com/fairpm/mini-fair-repo/tree/main#using-mini-fair)) and [Creating a DID for your package (GitHub)](https://github.com/fairpm/mini-fair-repo/tree/main#creating-a-did-for-your-package)
