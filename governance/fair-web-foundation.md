Note:
This is proposed copy from the FAIR Initiatives page under “Governance”:

With transparent governance as a core value, The FAIR Web Foundation is currently working on formalizing a governing board which will exercise its duties according to the charter it has adopted. Due to requests for privacy or non-disclosure from potential stakeholders and board candidates, this effort is being led by a small task force with a specific mandate rather than by a public Working Group.
