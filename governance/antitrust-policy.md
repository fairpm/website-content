# Antitrust Policy

The FAIR Package Manager follows the Linux Foundationâ€™s Antitrust Policy, which ensures that all project activities comply with applicable competition laws. The policy is designed to protect participants from antitrust risks, encourage fair and open collaboration, and prevent anti-competitive practices in meetings, membership, and standards development.
