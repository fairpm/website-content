# Roadmap

## Preamble

We recognize that as in all Open Source projects, we are [standing on the shoulders of giants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants). From that vantage point, we can draft a map of where we hope to go as well as a plan to get there. Following a “release early, release often” format (sometimes known as “building in public”), our roadmap is subject to change, and naturally offers more detail and planned release dates in the near-term than the long term.

As such, we caution that where we are today is not where we are going. Our approach will be to build from an MVP (“[Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)”) which is not yet feature-complete, and prioritize the addition of new features and capabilities according to the needs of the user community. To this end, we will often have initiatives in the “proof of concept” stage, or may have anticipated a need or a feature which is not yet documented or reflected in the timeline as each FAIR Working Group makes its own progress at differing paces. For example, the FAIR Plugin targets a release cadence of every 6th Tuesday, while AspireCloud sets milestone releases on an “as and when ready” basis.

With a number of initiatives overseen by various Working Groups, FAIR’s “roadmap” might be considered a bit more like a multilane highway. Additional information will be available within each working group and in the regular TSC meetings.
