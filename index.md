FAIR’s primary goal is to improve security in the software supply chain while establishing a decentralized distribution model where no single entity controls the supply chain from end to end.

Based on work by numerous contributors beginning in the fall of 2024, FAIR was conceptualized in early 2025 and announced in a public launch on June 5, 2025 in Basel, Switzerland. To help establish effective governance with third-party oversight, The FAIR Package Manager (FAIR Package Manager a Series of LF Projects, LLC) was then created as a project under the Linux Foundation.
